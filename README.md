# Recommended Movies

Stream Two Project: Interactive Front End Development with Javascript - Code Institute

This responsive, user-friendly website powered by "the movie DB" API allows users to search for any movie and get recommendations.

It's a single page application that uses https://www.themoviedb.org/ online Movie Database API allowing users to search for movies by keyword and then display a list of possible matches.

The user will then be able to select a movie from the list of search results. The app will then provide a list of recommended movie titles based on the selected movie.

## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://jessezauka.github.io/RecommendedMovies/).

## UX
I made the website as clear as I could, in order to give the user the most productive and enjoyable experience.

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

## Features
I have followed a minimalistic design strategy. The main goal of the website: the easiest possible way to recommend a visitor a movie based on his chosen movie title.

To achieve this goal I chosen a simple search form on the main page. 20 result shows up on one page. Website pagination shows up if there are more results.

Sometimes there are no recommendations found. The website will show up the message: "Sorry, there is no recommendations based on the movie "...".

## Testing

This site was tested across multiple browsers and on multiple mobile devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

This website is using the Movie Database API. Tested search results on multiple browsers. API search results reflect search results on the official Movie Database website.

## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages.
